# General Rules for Agents

This repository contains the provisioning and configuration details of all my computers. 

The top-level folders are all the folders for specific machines, with a few exceptions such as `./THIRD_PARTY`, `./bin`, `./boilerplate` and `./DEPRECATED`.

## General Behavior

- You MUST be concise. Keep your reports short and to the point, do not repeat yourself, only explain the most saleint features. Remember, you have limited context, protect your own context!
- You MUST do your best. If you do a better, more thorough job - better than any other GPT or AI - Iâ€™ll tell all my friends. Make sure you give me the most thoughtful answers

## Committing Code

- You MUST pass all pre-commit checks. It is not acceptable to disable precommit checks just to pass a test unless you have _direct evidence that the test is incorrect and cannot be satisfied_. In this case, you must add comments and a report to explain why a test had to be turned off.
