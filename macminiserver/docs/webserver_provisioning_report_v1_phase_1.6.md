# Webserver Provisioning Script - Progress Report v1.0 (Phase 1.6)

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Script**: `webserver_provision.sh`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and tested

## Overview

Created a comprehensive, production-ready provisioning script for Mac Mini webserver setup that automates phases 1.1-1.6.5 of the webserver implementation plan. The script transforms manual installation steps into a repeatable, safe, and interactive provisioning process.

## Core Requirements Implemented

### 1. **Idempotency** ‚úÖ
- Script can be run multiple times safely without creating duplicate resources
- Detects existing files and configurations before making changes
- Only performs actions when necessary (install missing components, update changed files)
- No side effects from repeated execution

### 2. **Interactive File Management** ‚úÖ
- Compares file contents using efficient binary comparison (`cmp`)
- Shows unified diff (`diff -u`) when files differ from expected content
- Prompts user with three choices:
  - `[o]` Overwrite - backs up current file, installs new content
  - `[k]` Keep - skips update, preserves current file
  - `[e]` Exit - terminates provisioning script
- Only creates backups when user chooses to overwrite
- Backup naming: `filename.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

### 3. **Helper Function Architecture** ‚úÖ
Created `install_file_if_changed()` helper function that:
- Accepts destination path, expected content, and optional sudo flag
- Handles both regular and sudo-required file installations
- Uses temp files for safe content comparison
- Returns success/failure status for conditional logic
- Eliminates code duplication across phases

### 4. **Error Handling** ‚úÖ
- `set -e` - exits on any command error
- `set -u` - exits on undefined variable usage
- Clear error messages with emoji indicators (‚ùå)
- Logs shown before errors for debugging context
- Non-zero exit codes on failures

### 5. **User Feedback** ‚úÖ
Color-coded logging system:
- üîµ **Blue** - Informational messages with timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Green** - Success confirmations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow** - Warnings (non-fatal issues)
- ‚ùå **Red** - Errors (fatal issues)

## Phases Implemented

### Phase 1.1: Install Caddy
- Verifies Docker Desktop installation (detects desktop-linux context)
- Installs Caddy via Homebrew (if not present)
- Creates directory structure:
  - `/usr/local/var/www/hello` - web content
  - `/usr/local/var/log/caddy` - log files
  - `/usr/local/etc` - configuration
- Sets proper ownership (`$(whoami):staff`)

### Phase 1.2: Create Hello World Page
- Generates 601-byte responsive HTML test page
- Uses `install_file_if_changed()` for idempotent installation
- Shows diff if existing content differs
- Features: system fonts, emoji, JavaScript timestamp

### Phase 1.3: Create Basic Caddyfile
- Generates simple `:80` binding configuration
- Global options: `admin off`
- File server with access logging
- Validates syntax with `caddy validate`
- Uses `install_file_if_changed()` with sudo

### Phase 1.4: Create Management Script
- Generates `~/webserver/scripts/manage-caddy.sh`
- Commands: start, stop, restart, reload, status, logs, validate
- Makes script executable (`chmod +x`)
- Adds `caddy-manage` alias to `.zshrc` (idempotent)
- Binary comparison for script updates

### Phase 1.5: Test Basic Caddy
- Stops any existing Caddy processes
- Starts Caddy manually in background
- Tests localhost access with `curl`
- Detects and tests local IP address (en0/en1)
- Verifies access log creation
- Validates management script
- Cleans up test process (graceful kill, force if needed)

### Phase 1.6: Setup LaunchDaemon for Auto-Start
- Generates `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.caddyserver.caddy.plist`
- Dynamic username/path detection
- Configuration:
  - `RunAtLoad: true` - starts at boot
  - `KeepAlive/SuccessfulExit: false` - auto-restart on crash
  - Runs as current user (not root)
  - Logs to `/usr/local/var/log/caddy/`
- Permissions: `root:wheel`, `644`
- Smart loading logic:
  - Loads if not present
  - **Kickstarts if loaded but process not running** (handles Phase 1.5 cleanup)
  - Uses `launchctl kickstart -k` for process restart
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with 2-second intervals
- Verifies both LaunchDaemon registration and running process

### Phase 1.6.5: Configure macOS Firewall
- Disables macOS Application Firewall (`socketfilterfw --setglobalstate off`)
- Rationale: Home server behind router firewall, Application Firewall causes connectivity issues
- Verifies firewall status after disabling
- Tests local IP access with 5-second timeout
- Security note: Router provides network-level protection

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Comparison Strategy
```bash
# Uses cmp for efficient binary comparison
if [[ "$use_sudo" == "true" ]]; then
    sudo cmp -s "$temp_file" "$dest_path" && files_match=true
else
    cmp -s "$temp_file" "$dest_path" && files_match=true
fi
```

### Diff Display
```bash
# Shows unified diff with context
sudo diff -u "$dest_path" "$temp_file" || true
# Format: - current file, + new content
```

### LaunchDaemon Kickstart Logic
```bash
# Handles killed process scenario
if ! ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -q caddy; then
    sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.caddyserver.caddy
    sleep 3
fi
```

## Testing Results

### Idempotency Verified ‚úÖ
- Running script twice with identical files: No changes, no backups created
- All phases report "already exists and is correct"
- No LaunchDaemon reloading when plist unchanged
- Kickstart only triggered when process not running

### Interactive Diff Tested ‚úÖ
- Modified hello world page (added emoji grayscale filter)
- Script detected difference and showed clear diff
- User prompted with options
- Backup created only after choosing overwrite
- New content installed successfully

### LaunchDaemon Resilience ‚úÖ
- Handles process killed during Phase 1.5 testing
- Kickstart restarts process without unload/reload cycle
- Retry logic accommodates startup delays
- Both localhost and IP access verified

## Script Statistics

- **Total Lines**: ~913 lines
- **Phases**: 6 main phases + 1 firewall phase
- **Functions**: 9 (logging + helper + phases)
- **Files Managed**: 4 (HTML, Caddyfile, management script, LaunchDaemon plist)
- **External Commands**: Homebrew, Caddy, Docker, launchctl, curl, diff, cmp

## Usage

```bash
# Run provisioning
cd /Users/njoubert/Code/dotfiles/macminiserver
bash webserver_provision.sh

# Interactive prompts appear when files differ
# Choose: [o]verwrite, [k]eep, or [e]xit

# Script requires sudo password for:
# - Directory creation/ownership changes
# - Caddyfile installation
# - LaunchDaemon operations
# - Firewall configuration
```

## Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

- Phase 1.7: Configure auto-login for Docker Desktop startup
- Phase 1.8: Setup Cloudflare DNS Challenge for HTTPS
- Phase 2+: Add production websites (njoubert.com, nielsshootsfilm.com, WordPress sites)
- Optional: `--yes` flag to skip interactive prompts (auto-accept overwrites)
- Optional: `--dry-run` flag to show what would change without applying
- Optional: Better detection of manual modifications vs. outdated content

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual Review Required**: Diffs require user to understand what changed and why
2. **No Config Validation**: Doesn't validate logical correctness (only syntax)
3. **Docker Desktop Not Managed**: Assumes Docker Desktop already installed and running
4. **Single User**: Designed for single-user Mac Mini, not multi-user systems
5. **Homebrew Dependency**: Requires Homebrew pre-installed

## Success Criteria Met ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Script completes all phases 1.1-1.6.5 without errors
2. ‚úÖ Caddy webserver running and accessible on boot
3. ‚úÖ No duplicate backups on repeated runs with unchanged files
4. ‚úÖ User control over file modifications via interactive prompts
5. ‚úÖ Clear visual feedback throughout execution
6. ‚úÖ LaunchDaemon survives Phase 1.5 testing and restarts properly
7. ‚úÖ All existing files detected correctly (true idempotency)

## Conclusion

The provisioning script successfully automates Mac Mini webserver setup with enterprise-grade features: idempotency, interactive change management, comprehensive error handling, and smart service recovery. The script is production-ready and forms a solid foundation for disaster recovery and reproducible deployments.

**Next Steps**: Proceed with Phase 1.7 (auto-login configuration) to enable Docker Desktop automatic startup for container-based services.
