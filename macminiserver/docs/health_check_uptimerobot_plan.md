# Health Check Endpoint for UptimeRobot - DONE!

**THIS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED**

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Goal:** Dead simple health monitoring for nielsshootsfilm.com using UptimeRobot

## Overview

Add a static health check endpoint that UptimeRobot can ping to verify the webserver is up.

**Implementation:** Static file approach (no dynamic server needed)

**Challenge:** nielsshootsfilm.com is an SPA that routes everything to index.html - we need an exception for the health check.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Health Check File

Create a simple static file that returns HTTP 200:

```bash
# Create health check endpoint
mkdir -p /Users/njoubert/webserver/sites/nielsshootsfilm.com/public/.well-known
tee /Users/njoubert/webserver/sites/nielsshootsfilm.com/public/.well-known/health << 'EOF'
OK
EOF
```

**Why `.well-known`?** Standard location for service metadata (like Let's Encrypt uses)

### 2. Update Nginx Config for SPA Exception

The current SPA routing (`try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;`) will route our health check to index.html. We need to add an exception BEFORE the SPA routing:

```bash
# Edit the nginx config
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/nielsshootsfilm.com.conf
```

Add this location block **BEFORE** the `location /` block:

```nginx
# Health check endpoint - must come BEFORE SPA routing
location /.well-known/health {
    access_log off;  # Don't clutter logs with monitoring pings
    add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    return 200 'OK';
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Nginx processes location blocks in order of specificity
- The exact match `/.well-known/health` takes precedence over the generic `/` location
- Using `return 200` is even faster than serving a static file
- `access_log off` prevents UptimeRobot pings from cluttering your logs

### 3. Reload Nginx

```bash
# Test the config
sudo nginx -t

# Reload nginx
sudo nginx -s reload
```

### 4. Test Locally

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
# Test the endpoint
curl https://nielsshootsfilm.com/.well-known/health

# Should return: OK
# HTTP status: 200

# Verify it's NOT routing to your SPA
curl -I https://nielsshootsfilm.com/.well-known/health
# Should show: Content-Type: text/plain (not text/html)
```

### 5. Configure UptimeRobot

### 5. Configure UptimeRobot

1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com/
2. Sign up / Log in (free tier: 50 monitors, 5 min intervals)
3. Click "Add New Monitor"
4. Configure:
   - **Monitor Type:** HTTP(s)
   - **Friendly Name:** nielsshootsfilm.com webserver
   - **URL:** `https://nielsshootsfilm.com/.well-known/health`
   - **Monitoring Interval:** 5 minutes (free tier)
   - **Alert Contacts:** Add your email

5. Click "Create Monitor"

### 6. Optional: Add Response Validation

In UptimeRobot advanced settings:
- **Keyword:** `OK` (alerts if response doesn't contain "OK")
- **Keyword Type:** Exists

## What This Monitors

✅ Nginx is running  
✅ SSL certificate is valid  
✅ DNS is resolving  
✅ Site is reachable  
✅ Basic file serving works

## Alternative: Static File Approach

If you prefer to serve an actual file instead of using `return 200`:

```bash
# Create the file
mkdir -p /Users/njoubert/webserver/sites/nielsshootsfilm.com/public/.well-known
echo "OK" > /Users/njoubert/webserver/sites/nielsshootsfilm.com/public/.well-known/health
```

Then use this nginx location block instead:

```nginx
# Health check endpoint - serve static file
location /.well-known/health {
    access_log off;
    add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    try_files $uri =404;  # Don't fall through to SPA routing
}
```

## What This Monitors

UptimeRobot free tier includes:
- Email alerts
- Push notifications (via mobile app)
- 50 SMS per month
- Webhook integrations (Slack, Discord, etc.)

## Done!

That's it. No dynamic server needed - just a static file that proves nginx can serve content over HTTPS.
