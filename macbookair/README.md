# Macbook Air M1 Dotfiles

## Managing Dotfiles

![Backup Dotfiles](images/backup-dotfiles.png)

I chose not to symlink paths.
Instead, the [`backup-dotfiles.sh`](backup-dotfiles.sh) script copies dotfiles from `~/` to this repository.
Then I use `git` to manage this repository.

Manually copy files back to your homedirectory to install. 

To add more files to backup, modify the config in [`backup-dotfiles.sh`](backup-dotfiles.sh).

| Action           | Method |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Backup Dotfiles  | `./backup-dotfiles.sh` then `git commit -am "<message>"` |
| Restore Dotfiles | Manually copy from this directory |
| Add Dotfiles     | Edit config in [`backup-dotfiles.sh`](backup-dotfiles.sh). |


# Running Notes

## 2024.07.01  Big Update ðŸ‘ˆ

After taking a new job at StackAV where I was asked to do more IC work, 
I spent time reconfiguring my terminal and vim.

### Fonts

I went down a rabbithole on [nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
In the end, I concluded that the simple fonts are the best ones, really.

- Text Editor: Monaco, the build-in Mac font, for text editing.
- Terminal: Meslo, the previous Mac font patched for programming.
- Alternative: Menlo, the previous Mac font.

All above fonts are patched with all the nerd font glyphs and available in the [fonts](./fonts/) directory.

### iTerm2

You have to configure iTerm2 to send Esc+ for Option keys, found in ` Profiles > Keys`

### ZSH, P10k and oh-my-zsh

**See [zshrc](zshrc) file**

![My Terminal](images/macbookair-terminal.png)

MacOS default shell is `zsh` so I'm going with that.

For custom prompts, there's the venerable [powershell10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) and the new kid [starship.rs](https://starship.rs/). I tried both and Powerlevel10k is faster, while Starship is buggy and the documentation is often incorrect. So, P10K it is. Just did the default config here.

*âœ¨Now we start to get [fancy](https://dev.to/abdfnx/oh-my-zsh-powerlevel10k-cool-terminal-1no0):âœ¨*

#### oh-my-zsh 
First, install oh-my-zsh
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
Then, check out the `.zshrc` and `.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh` and make sure you're happy with your new config.

#### p10k prompt
Then, we install the p10k theme.

```
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
```

And edit our `.zshrc` config to set the theme correctly:

```
# Disable the standard robbyrussell theme from oh-my-zsh
#ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell" 
# Enable p10k
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

I have P10k already configured in `.p10k.zsh` so right out of the box it works. 


#### zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin

```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

#### zsh-autosuggestions plugin

```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

#### enable plugins in .zshrc

Edit the `.zshrc` file to have this line:
```
plugins=( git zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions )
```

### Sublime Text 4 Enhancements

I do still use and love Sublime Text for how lightweight and great it is. 
At my last 3 jobs, everyone is using Visual Studio Code and there's a lot of good stuff in there, and that's my daily driver for work, but Sublime still is in my toolbelt.

Plugins:

- Markdown Extended
- MarkdownPreview
- MarkdownLivePreview
