## 2024.07.01  Big Update ðŸ‘ˆ

After taking a new job at StackAV where I was asked to do more IC work, 
I spent time reconfiguring my terminal and vim.

### ZSH Enhancements

MacOS default shell is `zsh` so I'm going with that.

For custom prompts, there's the venerable [powershell10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) and the new kid [starship.rs](https://starship.rs/). I tried both and Powerlevel10k is faster, while Starship is buggy and the documentation is often incorrect. So, P10K it is.

As for plugins, I have yet to get into [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and enable all the [fancy](https://dev.to/abdfnx/oh-my-zsh-powerlevel10k-cool-terminal-1no0) [stuff](https://www.lorenzobettini.it/2024/01/oh-my-zsh-and-powerlevel10k-in-macos/).

**See zshrc file**

### VIM Enhancements

Vim is a good quick-and-dirty text editor that I find myself using regularly on the command line.
So a little bit of tweaking to make it nice is great.

**See the vimrc file.**

### Sublime Text 4 Enhancements

I do still use and love Sublime Text for how lightweight and great it is. 
At my last 3 jobs, everyone is using Visual Studio Code and there's a lot of good stuff in there.
